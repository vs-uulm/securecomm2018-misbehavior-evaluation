# Evaluation data for Maat detectors using VeReMi

This repository stores the data associated with our SecureComm 2018 paper.
The generation scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/VeReMi-dataset/VeReMi-popper).
Basically, the graphs here are just the output of the scripts in the analysis folder.
The input for these scripts can be derived from any version of Maat; the data resulting from the version we studied in the paper can be found on [zenodo](https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1994034).
